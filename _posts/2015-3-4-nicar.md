**Dan Sinker** wants to talk to you about [becoming a news partner](http://opennews.org/getinvolved/newspartners/), [the Coral Project](http://coralproject.net/), and about anything else OpenNews. **Erika Owens** is taking point on the [Knight-Mozilla Fellowships](http://opennews.org/what/fellowships/) and [OpenNews-sponsored hack days and other events](http://opennews.org/what/community/eventsupport/). If you're interested in [pitching or attending a code convening](http://opennews.org/what/community/convenings/), or talking about MozFest this fall in London, **Ryan Pitts** is your man, and **Erin Kissane** will be lurking in sessions and hallways to chat about [Source articles](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/), [SRCCON pitches](http://srccon.org/), and [OpenNews community calls](http://opennews.org/what/community/calls/). 

We'll also have [the entire 2015 cohort of Knight-Mozilla Fellows](http://opennews.org/what/fellowships/2015meet/) in attendance, and they are eager to dig into the technical and cultural details of your work as they get settled into their newsrooms.
