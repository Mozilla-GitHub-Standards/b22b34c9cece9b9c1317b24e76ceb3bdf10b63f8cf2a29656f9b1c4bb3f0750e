<title>Making SRCCON Good for Humans</title>
<dc:creator></dc:creator>

<description>We wanted the attendees of SRCCON to be able to focus on the conference itself—sessions, activities, and other official stuff, but also the conversations in hallways and corners that are usually a highlight of gatherings of enthusiastic colleagues. To make that possible, we tried to arrange the SRCCON schedule, space, and life-support systems to be as accommodating and supportive as possible.</description>

<title>Announcing our 2015 Knight-Mozilla Fellows!</title>
<dc:creator></dc:creator>

<description>Live from the 2014 Mozilla Festival in London, we&#39;re thrilled to introduce our 2015 Knight-Mozilla Fellows. The work that the Knight-Mozilla Fellows do during their fellowship year doesn&#39;t fit easily into a single sentence. Over the year a fellow will play the role of coder, teacher, mentor (and mentee), adventurer, colleague, and friend. They&#39;ll push themselves, and journalism, in new directions. They&#39;ll do work that has real impact--on themselves and on the web. It&#39;s a tall order, but a thrilling one, and the people we have lined up to do the work of a Knight-Mozilla Fellow in 2015 are among our very best yet. I can&#39;t wait for you to meet them.</description>
