<p>Brian Jacobs is a designer and interactive developer. He's passionate about multi-faceted visual tools that are civic-minded, scientific, journalistic, or otherwise educational, to benefit the people and their habitat. He's worked in commercial and academic contexts, on GIS projects in West Virginia, web apps in Philadelphia, and towards an urban data processing and visualization platform for the MIT SENSEable City Lab, in Singapore. He's excited about the future of open data, particularly collaborative and semantic web initiatives that can afford reproducible access to cleaner, more interdisciplinary data. Brian is also intensely interested in bagels, hikes, and sci-fi camp.</p>

For fun, she runs a radio show based on the semantic web, and digs studying, silent discos, and shoegaze; follow her: @auremoser, or at algorhyth.ms.
