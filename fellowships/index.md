<h2>Become a Knight-Mozilla Fellow</h2>
<p class="bodybig">Knight-Mozilla Fellows spend 10 months embedded in partner newsrooms. They are developers, technologists, civic hackers, and data crunchers who are [paid](benefitslink) to work with the community inside and outside of their newsroom to develop and share open-source projects. Fellows work in the open by sharing their code and their discoveries, helping to strengthen and build journalism's toolbox.</p>

###Embedded in the Newsroom
The Knight-Mozilla Fellows are able to experience the day-to-day energy of some of the best newsrooms in the world. Being present as news  breaks, writing code for the day's headlines, wrangling thorny datasets, and taking a step back to  solve real-world journalistic problems, the Knight-Mozilla Fellows' work is rooted in developing projects that help us better understand our world. Prior Fellows have gone on to use their newsroom experience in developing tools for journalists and working full-time as a data journalist. 

###Working in the Open
Knight-Mozilla Fellows share the work they're doing with the world  outside of the newsroom. By blogging their experiences, pushing code to  open repositories, taking part in the OpenNews [community calls](https://wiki.mozilla.org/OpenNews/Calls), and  engaging with other developers, the Knight-Mozilla Fellows are helping  to spread the code they're making and strengthen the  journalism-developer community. And given that news is such a large part of the web, the open work of the Fellows contributes to a more transparent and accessible open web.
