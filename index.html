<p class="bodybig">The Knight-Mozilla Fellowships bring some of the best minds on the internet into newsrooms for 10 months of open-source experimentation. Journalism code shapes much of what we see on the open web. Knight-Mozilla Fellows tackle the challenges facing news organizations by creative problem solving using code. <a href="/what/fellowships/apply">Our search for the 2016 Fellows is now open</a>, and the deadline for applications is August 21, 2015.</p>
