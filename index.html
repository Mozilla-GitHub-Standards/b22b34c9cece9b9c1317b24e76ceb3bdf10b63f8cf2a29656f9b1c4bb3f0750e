<p class="bodybig">
This July, <a href="http://srccon.org">OpenNews&#8217; flagship event, SRCCON</a>, returns for its third year. SRCCON is a hands-on conference focused on the challenges news technology and data teams encounter every day, and we work to make it an inclusive and welcoming event.</p> 
<p> We keep SRCCON intentionally small, and this year&#8217;s tickets have already been allocated, but we&#8217;re working on a bunch of options for remote participation and documentation to make SRCCON&#8217;s benefits available to all. The SRCCON spirit will also continue on with <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/">the Mozilla Festival</a> in London in October.</p>
