<h2>Celebrate Journalism of the Open Web</span></h2>
<p class="bodybig">In October, OpenNews will run the Journalism and Open Data tracks at the <a href="http://www.mozillafestival.org">Mozilla Festival</a>, the annual open-source learning and making extravaganza in London. MozFest is a hands-on conference where participants collaborate in workshops designed to make it easy to think, prototype, hack, and build together. At the end of the weekend, participants have new ideas, new relationships, and new items in their tool kit to bring back to their newsroom or open source community.</p>
<p>Come hack with OpenNews: learn, teach, and make journalism that's native to the open web. <a href="http://2014.mozillafestival.org/propose/">Propose a session</a> by August 22 or <a href="https://sendto.mozilla.org/page/contribute/mozilla-festival-2014-registration">register to attend</a> the Festival in London, October 24-26.</p>

<h2>We are OpenNews</h2>
<p>We're helping a global network of developers, journalists, makers, and hackers collaborate on innovative code and new ideas. We believe a community of peers working, learning, and solving problems together can create the tools journalism needs to thrive on the open web. Here's how:
      <h3>Fellowships</h3>
      <p>Knight-Mozilla Fellows are developers, technologists, civic hackers, and data crunchers who receive a paid 10-month fellowship to develop open-source projects in our partner newsrooms. <a href="/fellowships">Learn more</a>.
</p>

<h3>Code</h3>
<p>We believe the code that's being written in journalism today is transformative to the wider web. At OpenNews, we help create and support open-source tools like data visualization libraries, election data parsers, and civic data scrapers that fill real-world needs in newsrooms around the globe and build a stronger, more secure, more accessible internet. <a href="/code.html">Here's how</a>.</p>

<h3>Hack Days and Events</h3>
<p>We sponsor hack days and journalism code events across the globe to build community, code, and momentum for solving problems that working journalists face. <a href="/hackdays.html">Start hacking with us</a>.
</p>
      <h3>Source</h3>
      <p>We run Source as a centerpoint for the code being written throughout the journalism community. From features that explore the context behind the code to targeted job listings that help the community expand, Source presents the people, projects, and insights behind journalism code. <a href="http://source.opennews.org/">Visit now.</a></p>

      <h3>Community</h3>
      <p>The hacker-journalist community is a vibrant one, and we're helping it grow in size as well as strength. A diverse array of skills and experiences in technology are necessary to tackle the challenges facing journalism, and we're excited about bringing new people into this community. We want to engage the community at every step, that means we need your help. <a href="/getinvolved.html">Get involved.</a>
