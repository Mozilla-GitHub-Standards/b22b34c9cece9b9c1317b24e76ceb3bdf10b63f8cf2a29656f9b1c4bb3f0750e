<h2>What is OpenNews?</h2>
<p>OpenNews is a collaboration between the Knight Foundation and Mozilla that's dedicated to building an ecosystem to help journalism thrive on the open web. It's about producing next-generation web solutions that solve real problems in news. It's about supporting  communities of developers and journalists as they make, learn, and invent  together. And it's about deploying <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/fellowships">fellows</a>—and code—into news  organizations to collaborate and innovate in new ways.</p>

            <h3>Fellowships</h3>
            <p>Knight-Mozilla Fellows spend 10 months embedded in partner newsrooms. They are [paid](benefitslink) to work with the community inside and outside of their newsroom to develop and share open-source projects that, [in a variety of ways](communityoffellowslink OR http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/organizations/opennews/), help to transform journalism on the web. <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/fellowships">Learn more.</a>

            <h3>Hack days</h3>
            <p>We sponsor hack days across the globe to write code and build community and momentum around creating technical solutions to problems that working journalists face. <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/hackdays.html">Get involved.</a>

            <h3>Source</h3>
            <p>We run <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/">Source</a> as a centerpoint for the code being written throughout the journalism community. From features that give the context behind the code, to an index of the community making it, Source is dedicated capturing the people and projects behind journalism code. <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/">Visit now.</a></p>
           <h3>Community</h3>
            <p>The hacker-journalist community is a vibrant one, and all our initiatives are designed to help it grow in size as well as strength. A diverse array of skills and experiences in technology are necessary to tackle the challenges facing journalism, and we're excited about bringing new people into this community. We  want to engage the community at every step, that means we need your help. <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/getinvolved.html">Here's how.</a>
