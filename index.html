<p class="bodybig">
We are excited to introduce our <a href="/what/fellowships/2016meet">fifth cohort of Knight-Mozilla Fellows</a>. As they begin their fellowships, they join the ranks of our 26 current fellows and alumni as bridge-builders, toolmakers, and leaders in newsrooms and across the open web. The fellows spend ten months in 2016 working in the open and collaborating with <a href="/what/fellowships/partners/">some of the best news organizations in the world</a>. </p>
