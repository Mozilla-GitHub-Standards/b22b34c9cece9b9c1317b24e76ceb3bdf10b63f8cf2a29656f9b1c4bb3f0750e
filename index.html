<p class="bodybig">
This July, OpenNews' flagship annual conference <a href="http://srccon.org">SRCCON</a> will be back for the third time. SRCCON is a hands-on conference focused on the practical challenges news technology and data teams encounter every day.</p> 
<p>We work to make SRCCON an inclusive and welcoming event where people can feel comfortable digging into complex problems. We keep SRCCON intentionally small, which means tickets have already been allocated. But we're working on a bunch of options for remote participation and documenation. The SRCCON spirit will continue again at <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/">the Mozilla Festival</a> in October.</p>
