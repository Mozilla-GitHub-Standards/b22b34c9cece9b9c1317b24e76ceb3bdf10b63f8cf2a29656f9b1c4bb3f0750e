Plus, it's role-playing, so participants will also get to play trollls and vested interests who will try to thwart the brave and valiant verifiers as they seek to get the facts out in real time.

Open source tools like Datawrapper, Chartbuilder, Highcharts, and others help journalists build quick and easy charts. But there’s room for growth. Join us in discussing the future of these tools. We’ll look at existing tools, discuss your experiences and pain points (both as users and developers), and figure out how to move forward to build something we all can use and love."
