<p class="bodybig">At OpenNews, we believe in building <i>with</i> our community, not simply <i>for</i> it. Partnerships with news organizations around the world help shape, guide, and implement our programs. As the hosts of our flagship Knight-Mozilla Fellowship program, as contributors to Source, as participants in Code Convenings, as organizers of hack days, our news partners are a crucial part of OpenNews. 
<br>
<br>
Here's how you can get involved:</p>

###Guiding new leaders

Our [Knight-Mozilla Fellowship](/fellowships) program brings talented developers into newsrooms to research, experiment, and try new things. Our fellows have been hosted by news organizations around the world that welcome inquisitive outsiders and act as leaders in the journalism code community. Whether large or small, there are a few principles we look for in fellowship partners. If your newsroom is interested in hosting a fellow, please look over our [fellowship partner guidelines](/partnerguidelines.html).

###Sharing knowledge

From visualization libraries to data extractors and presentation templates, newsrooms are creating some of the most exciting code on the internet right now. We highlight that work on [Source](http://source.opennews.org), our website dedicated to the code in journalism and the people who write it. On Source, news organizations share the code, process, and thinking behind news applications and interactives. The resources on the site are a direct result of the generosity and efforts of the developers, designers, and newsrooms who are willing to show their work. Join them by [sharing your contributions](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/contribute/) today.

###Building together

In 2014 OpenNews will host two [Code Convenings](/code.html), new events that bring together some of the best newsroom developers in the world with leading independent talents to work together to on a particular topic. Code convening teams will open-source newsroom code and build new applications and libraries to address journalistic problems. Want to take part? [Let us know you're interested](mailto:opennews@mozillafoundation.org?Subject=code%20convenings) and we'll keep you posted on these events as they develop.

###Creating community

We partner with news organizations and others around the world to foster journalism-code collaboration by hosting and organizing [news-themed hack days](/hackdays.html). If you'd like us to help with your hack day, [tell us about](https://sendto.mozilla.org/page/s/knight-mozilla-news-hack-day) your proposed event. Starting in 2014, we will also begin organizing training events, particularly with smaller news organizations. If you think we may be able to help suport the journalism-code community in your news organization or town, [drop us a line](mailto:opennews@mozillafoundation.org?Subject=training%20events).

We also directly support the creation and build-out of newsroom technology teams through [Source Jobs](http://source.opennews.org/jobs), a listings service that allows newsrooms to post and edit news apps and data journalism jobs, as well as administering their overall presence on Source. [Get started](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/jobs/#about-jobs) by designating a jobs contact for your organization.
