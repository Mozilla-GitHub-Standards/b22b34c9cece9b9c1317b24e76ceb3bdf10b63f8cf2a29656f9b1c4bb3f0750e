title: Fellowship Partner Guidelines

<p class="bodybig">At OpenNews, the partners we select to host our Knight-Mozilla Fellows do more than simply offer a desk at their news organization: they are crucial partners who mentor and advise our Fellows as well as offering them access to journalistic problem-sets and experts within their newsrooms.</p>

We look for Fellowship partners who:

* have a proven track record for innovation
* place their development team in the newsroom
* agree to define a problem-space or project that they'd like their Fellow to work on
* commit to being involved in other OpenNews endeavors, including Code Convenings and Source
* agree to cover travel costs for a representative to attend the annual Mozilla Festival (twice), a news partner onboarding event at the beginning of the Fellowship period, and at least one other OpenNews-related event while hosting their Fellow
* are invested in being a leader in the journalism-code community

If you want to learn more about how to become involved as a OpenNews Fellowship Partner for 2015, [please contact us](mailto:opennews@mozillafoundation.org?Subject=fellowship%20partner). We'd love to chat about how you can become involved in the program. And if being a Fellowship partner doesn't sound like a fit for your news organization, please check out the other ways OpenNews [partners with newsrooms](/newspartners.html).
