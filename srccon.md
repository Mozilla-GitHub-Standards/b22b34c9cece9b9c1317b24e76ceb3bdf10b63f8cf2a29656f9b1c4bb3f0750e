<p class="bodybig"><a href="http://srccon.org">SRCCON</a> is an OpenNews event for developers, interactive designers, and others who love to code in and near newsrooms. In a nutshell, SRCCON is a conference built around conversations and collaboration, not lectures and onstage demos. Sessions will run as facilitated conversations and workshops rather than traditional conference talks.</p>

[Registration is open now](http://srccon.org/register), and [session proposals are open](http://srccon.org/sessions) until June 9. Tickets cost $150, and we expect them to go quickly, so if you're interested in attending, [get over there](http://srccon.org/register).

###Who Should Attend?
Newsroom developers and designers are at the center of our work at Source, but if you work or play with code as a journalist, civic hacker, open data technologist, or related role, you’ll absolutely fit in.We expressly invite participation from underrepresented groups, and welcome all. We believe in the news code community’s goodwill, and we also believe conference organizers are responsible for providing clear expectations and processes for problems that arise. We take our [code of conduct](http://srccon.org/conduct) seriously, and if you come to Philly and feel vulnerable, we will have your back.

###We Need Your Help
SRCCON is an opportunity for an already amazing community to have time and space to learn, build, and have fun together in a focused way—but to make that happen, we need to reach the whole community. If you know someone who might love SRCCON but isn’t as likely to hear about it through the usual channels, please give that person a nudge in our direction.
