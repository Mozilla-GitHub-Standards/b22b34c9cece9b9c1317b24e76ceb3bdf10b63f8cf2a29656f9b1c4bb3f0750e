<p class="bodybig">The journalism code community is diverse and distributed across the globe. <a href="/what/community/eventsupport">Events can be a great opportunity</a> to get together in person to chat and collaborate, but sometimes the cost of travel can be a hardship. To help defray the cost of attending conferences and other technical events, OpenNews is <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NpOrZSbqWdUUtjy8K3qqhfnlkJ_Cuky96K-M43CyvlA/viewform">now offering Ticket + Travel scholarships</a>.</p>

**When will I receive my scholarship?**<br>
When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship funds. In short, you will need to send us an invoice, and our administrators will process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.
 
**What if I need more than $500 for my travel?**<br>
We’re able to offer $500 scholarships at this time. Many events and professional organizations offer their own scholarship programs as well. Or maybe your event has things like a room share board to help cut down on costs.

**Why are you offering this scholarship?**<br>
We know that a lot of important work, sharing, and learning happens at in-person events. It's not easy for everyone to get to those events though, no matter how valuable they may be. We know that travel costs can be a hardship, and offer this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that.

**How do you decide who will receive a scholarship?**<br>
OpenNews staff reviews all applications. We prioritize applications from members of communities under-represented in journalism and technology, as well as from people who would be unable to speak at or majorly contribute to an event without the scholarship.

**What about your conference, SRCCON?**<br>
We ran a [separate scholarship process](http://srccon.org/scholarships/) for that event and unfortunately, the deadline has already passed.
