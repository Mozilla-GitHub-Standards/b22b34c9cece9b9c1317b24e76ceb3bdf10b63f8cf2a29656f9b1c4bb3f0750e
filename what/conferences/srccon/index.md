<p class="bodybig"><a href="http://srccon.org/">SRCCON returns for 2015!</a> Join us in Minneapolis on June 24 and 25 for two days of building better newsroom code, culture, and processâ€”together. Tickets go on sale April 29, and session proposals open March 18. </p>

Learn more about [where we'll be](http://srccon.org/location/), how to [propose a session](http://srccon.org/sessions/), and [the registration process](http://srccon.org/tickets/), and start planning your pitches now. (We sold out tickets in three minutes last year, so if you're interested, you'll want to [get on the announcements list](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/subscribe/).)
