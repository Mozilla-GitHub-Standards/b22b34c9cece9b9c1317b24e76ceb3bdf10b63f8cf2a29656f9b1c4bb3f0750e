<p class="bodybig">Knight-Mozilla Fellows spend 10 months working in partner news organizations and collaborating with the journalism-technology community around the world. Each group of fellows enters their newsroom with the support of the rest of their cohort as well as a growing alumni community. <a href="/what/fellowships/apply" Apply to join them today.</a>

###THINGS THEY MAKE
Knight-Mozilla Fellows work on projects with their newsroom colleagues, with each other, with new friends at hack days, and yes, sometimes even in an over-caffeinated blur alone at their laptops. Fellows have had [bylines](http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/medizin/gesundheitsoekonomen-fordern-qualitaetsmessung-im-system-a-882665.html) on newsroom projects and spurred the development of [new tools](https://github.com/jazzido/tabula). They've [won hack days](https://review.wizehive.com/voting/view/elaustria2013/13692/1166806) and pursued [passion projects](http://source.mozillaopennews.org/articles/mapping-history-street-names/). They've [done research](http://sonya2song.blogspot.com/2013/06/talk-on-news-censorship.html) that gives us a better understanding of journalism and [its impact](http://brianabelson.com/open-news/2013/03/18/A-Metric-For-News-Apps.html). Fellows get to spend 10 months working on projects that matter.

###PLACES THEY GO
Many fellows move to a new city or a new country to join their host news organization. But the travel does not end there. In addition to helping organize events in [their newsroom](https://github.com/veltman/learninglunches/) or [host city](http://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Berlin/), fellows attend, present, and hack at events around the world. From [Barcelona](http://jazzido.github.io/presentacion-jpd13-barcelona/#/) to [Budapest](http://inklink2013.wordpress.com/2013/05/28/179/), [New York](http://www.bdatafest.computationalreporting.com/projects/fms-symphony) to [London](http://martinbelam.com/2013/hacks-hackers-knight-mozilla-fellows/), throughout [Latin America](http://datamineruk.com/2012/09/17/data-journalism-in-argentina/), and many places in between, fellows get to see the world while collaborating with journalists and developers to find solutions to real problems facing news organizations.

###TIME THEY SPEND TOGETHER
Unlike many fellowship programs, Knight-Mozilla Fellows spend the bulk of their time with their news organization rather than being together in a group. But Knight-Mozilla Fellows are still able to create a sense of community, share ideas, and support one another throughout the fellowship. In addition to connecting virtually, the entire group of fellows comes together several times throughout the fellowship. The program kicks off with an [on-boarding event](http://dansinker.com/post/41711568489/opennews-building-a-community-of-fellows), and over the year OpenNews brings the fellows together at other events such as the [SRCCON](http://srccon.org) and the [Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires Media Party](http://mediaparty.hhba.info/). As Fellows develop projects or interest areas, they also gather for smaller group events and trainings.
