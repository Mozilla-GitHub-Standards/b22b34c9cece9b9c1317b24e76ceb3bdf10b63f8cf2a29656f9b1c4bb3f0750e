<p class="caption">All 26 of our current and former Knight-Mozilla Fellows.</p>
<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p class="bodybig">The Knight-Mozilla Fellows spend 10 months working with a partner news organization, contributing to and learning from the journalism code community. A growing community of fellowship alumni also welcomes and supports each new cohort. Fellows share their curiosity,  code, and insights during their fellowship and beyond. <a href="/what/fellowships/apply">Apply to join  them today</a>.

Meet our fellows: [2015](/what/fellowships/2015meet) | [2014](/what/fellowships/2014meet) | [2013](/what/fellowships/2013meet) | [2012](/what/fellowships/2011meet)

Throughout the program, we encourage fellows to explore their passions, collaborate on projects, and share their work. Here are some examples of work from current and alumni fellows.

## Explore
The mandate to explore is one of the ways a fellowship is really different from a regular job. Fellows have the time, space, and support to learn new skills, investigate topics of interest to them, and experiment to answer questions that fascinate them.

###Livia Labate - current fellow at NPR
<img src="/media/img/fellows/2015-fellows/livia60.jpg" class="fellowspage">Livia  came to the fellowship with more than a decade of UX experience, but she wanted to focus on gaining [experience with programming and shipping code](http://livialabate.com/says/so-you-think-you-can-dance/).  She's documented her efforts to learn git, get a handle on python, and work on a rapid development cycle. She has also shared her UX and audience research expertise with the NPR team while learning a ton of new skills.

### Brian Jacobs - 2014 fellow at ProPublica
<img src="/media/img/fellows/2014-fellows/brian-60.png" class="fellowspage">Brian immersed himself in a mammoth project: analyzing data tracking coastline erosion in Louisiana and combining that with on-the-ground  reporting to create "[Losing Ground](http://projects.propublica.org/louisiana/)." Brian took his prior experience with mapping and interest in science and dove into a [huge project](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/how-we-made-losing-ground/) to understand historical, satellite, and even [balloon-mapped](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/reporting-youngest-land-earth/) imagery and then figure out how to make it accessible and understandable to readers.

###Mark Boas - 2012 fellow at Al Jazeera
<img src="/media/img/fellows/mark_small.jpg" class="fellowspage">Mark came to the fellowship with a wealth of experience with online audio and video. This was a great fit for interactive projects at Al Jazeera as well as efforts to add better navigation and captioning support to news events like the 2012 presidential debates. Mark has continued his  work on [Hyperaudio](http://hyperaud.io/), which syncs online video and captions and makes it much easier to edit and search video, with the support of groups including Mozilla's WebFWD and the Knight Foundation.

## Collaborate
Working together is at the heart of open source development and fellows have the chance to combine forces with their newsroom colleagues, the other fellows in their cohort, the wider journalism-code community, and beyod.

###Kavya Sukumar - current fellow at Vox Media

<img src="/media/img/fellows/2015-fellows/kavya60.jpg" class="fellowspage">Kavya and colleagues on the Vox Product team collaborated to open source  [Autotune](https://github.com/voxmedia/autotune/), a tool to make it easier to create templates for things like  quizzes and charts. Rather than developers needing to create a new quiz every time a writer wants to create one, a quiz "blueprint" can be created once and used endlessly by the writer directly, who enters a few bits of information and gets the embed code. Vox had been using the  tool internally, and with Kavya's help they were able [to open source  it](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-autotune/) so other orgs can use it, too.

###Gabriela Rodriguez - 2014 fellow at La Nacion
<img src="/media/img/fellows/2014-fellows/gabriela-60.png" class="fellowspage">Gabriela picked up the work of her predecessor at La Nacion, Manuel Aristarán, to create an [open source tool for crowdsourcing analysis of PDF documents](https://github.com/crowdata/crowdata). Inspired by the "Free the Files" project at ProPublica, La Nacion created crowdata to gather data about government spending. The open source project also involved "checkathon" events where readers and university students could participate by checking the documents and logging the relevant details, no coding required.

###Manuel Aristarán - 2013 fellow at La Nacion
<img src="/media/img/fellows/manuel_small.jpg" class="fellowspage">Manuel struggled with accessing public data in Argentina that was often trapped in PDFs. He began working on a tool to help extract tabular data from PDFs and mentioned this at the onboarding for fellows. Scott Klein of ProPublica was also there and his team had been working on this same  challenge. They compared their two separate projects, and decided to collaborate, using Manuel's project as the codebase. Mike Tigas and  ProPublica colleague Jeremy B. Merrill collaborated with Manuel to [launch TabulaPDF](http://tabula.technology/) in 2013 and have continued its development.

## Share
A handful of individuals get to spend 10 months as a fellow, but by documenting, speaking, and teaching about their work, fellows expand the reach of their efforts and allow the rest of the journalism-code community to benefit from their work.

###Francis Tseng and Tara Adiseshan - 2015 fellows at The Coral Project
<img src="/media/img/fellows/2015-fellows/francis60.jpg" class="fellowspage"><img src="/media/img/fellows/2015-fellows/tara60.jpg" class="fellowspage">
Francis and Tara joined [The Coral Project](coralproject.net), a collaboration between Mozilla, The  New York Times, and The Washington Post to improve communities on news sites through open-source software, and got straight to work on research. They immersed themselves in learning about how communities interact online and what communities outside of news may be able to teach news sites. Francis and Tara have shared their research at the New York Times and at events including the Allied Media Conference and SRCCON.

###Harlo Holmes - 2014 fellow at The New York Times<br>Aurelia Moser - 2014 fellow at Ushahidi and Internews Kenya
<img src="/media/img/fellows/2014-fellows/harlo-60.png" class="fellowspage"><img src="/media/img/fellows/2014-fellows/aurelia-60.png" class="fellowspage">Harlo and Aurelia wanted to help journalists understand how and why to communicate securely with sources. Harlo brought her extensive experience in the security community and Aurelia brought her curiosity  about apps and communication to develop several talks about [opsec for journalists](https://github.com/auremoser/dropitlike/blob/master/README.md). They presented together, alongside Barton Gellman at HOPE, and at the Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires Media Party. Harlo now teaches about security full time as Digital Security Trainer at the Freedom of the Press Foundation and Aurelia continues to speak and teach at tech events around the world.

###Brian Abelson - 2013 fellow at The New York Times
<img src="/media/img/fellows/brian_small.jpg" class="fellowspage">Brian brought his statistics background to studying analytics and impact throughout his fellowship. The time he spent understanding analytics from the NYT led him to developing the concept of "[pageviews above replacement](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/promotion-pageviews/)," a way of understanding the expected baseline for a type of content and the promotion it received so that you can identify when pieces really exceed expectations. This led to a Tow Center fellowship where, along with Michael Keller and Stijn Debrouwere (2013 fellow at The Guardian) Brian continued his research. In 2015, Brian and Michael [released a major white paper](http://towcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tow_Center_NewsLynx_Full_Report.pdf) and [open sourced their work](http://newslynx.readthedocs.org/) on NewsLynx.
