<p class="bodybig">The application to become a 2016 Knight-Mozilla Fellow <a href="/what/fellowships/apply">is now open</a>. It will remain open until August 21, 2015.

###How does the application review and matching process work?
Applications are submitted through a Screendoor form and are visible at the time they are submitted, but formal review does not begin until after the application deadline closes on August 16.

**Initial review**

* OpenNews staff review all of the applications and cull the batch to a manageable number for the news partners to review.
* The news partners review this shorter list and submit a list of the five people they are most interested in learning more about.
* These semifinalists are contacted for interviews. Applicants who are not moving forward in the selection process are notified.

**Semifinalists**

* Dan and Erika conduct short, standardized interviews with the semifinalists, asking a few questions that are about vision and skills/practical considerations.
* The notes from these interviews are submitted back to the news partners for review, and the news partners are able to pick their top three finalists from the entire pool of semifinalists, not just the five they initially submitted. (Last year there was a lot of crossover at this stage.)
* The semifinalists who are not moving forward are notified of their application status.

**Finalists**

* The news organization and OpenNews has a much longer interview with each of that news organization’s top three candidates. This interview is a chance for the news partner and the finalist to learn more about each other and what to expect from a fellowship at that news organization.
* In consultation with OpenNews and the news partners, the final fellow selection is made for each news organization.

**Fellowship Announcements**

* The selected fellows are notified and given an opportunity to ask additional questions of the news partner and OpenNews.
* The finalists that were not selected as fellows are notified of their application status.
* A public announcement of the fellows is made at the [Mozilla Festival](http://www.mozillafestival.org).

###Common Questions

**What is a "fellow" and a “fellowship”?**

In this context, a fellow is someone who shares qualities or interests with a particular community. Our fellowship is a program that brings together a diverse group of people with common interests and skills—the Knight-Mozilla Fellows—to share the experience of working on open code in newsrooms.

**I only know [insert programming language here] or only have [back end/front end/design/mapping/data] development experience, should I still apply?**

Absolutely! There is no requirement for a particular programming language or development skillset. A lot of news app development happens in front end, especially mapping and visualization, and people with those skills are highly sought after. Statistics, data, and even hard math skills are also great.

**I don’t speak English very well or live in the U.S. Can I still participate?**

We are an international program and welcome participants from around the world. You do not need to be a U.S. citizen to participate in the program. We assist fellows with any necessary visa applications for working and traveling during the fellowship. Perfect English is not a requirement, however please be aware that it may be challenging to participate in some aspects of our program if your English is limited.

**What are you looking for with the example projects on the application?**

We want to see three projects that you are proud of. Tell us why you’re excited about the project, and if you made the project has part of a team, describe the contribution that you made. The examples you include are not shared beyond the small pool of application reviewers.

**What if my example projects don’t include open source contributions?**

That’s okay. We understand that a lot of people have done work that is not open source. Many people have never made a contribution back to an open source project, but use those tools frequently. You will be building in the open and contributing back to open source projects as a fellow, but it is not a requirement to have done this before applying. For reference, many current fellows had few open source contributions before becoming fellows.

**What kind of competition are you expecting with the fellowship?**

This is the fifth year of the fellowship search process. For the past three years, we’ve followed the application search model we’re using this year. Each year the number of applicants has increased about 150% percent. Last year we received 416 applications and we anticipate that we will receive a similar or larger number.

This year, we have seven fellowship slots available and expect that the process will remain highly competitive. We thoroughly review each application we receive, which gives us an opportunity to get to know you better. We seek out ways to keep in touch and work with the many highly skilled applicants who do not become fellows.

In terms of assessing the applicant pool, what has remained  consistent each year is that we are committed to matching the skills of the fellow to the needs of the news organization. It’s a very individualized matching process.

**I have applied to the fellowship before, but did not get selected. Should I apply again?**

Yes! Please apply again. Each year, we get more applications from amazingly qualified candidates than we are able to accept as fellows, but that does not mean we wouldn't love to work with those candidates. The needs of the fellowship partner news organizations change from year to year so it becomes a different selection process every year. And that means, sometimes someone who was not selected as a fellow one year, becomes a fellow the next. 2015 fellow Kavya Sukumar [wrote about her experience](http://blog.kavyasukumar.com/third-time-is-the-charm/) getting the fellowship, on her third try.

**I’m still on the fence about applying.**

You should apply. If you have experience with code and an interest in  journalism and you’re curious about applying, do so. As former fellow  Noah Veltman [pointed out](http://veltman.tumblr.com/post/56132893301/code-the-newsroom-and-self-doubt), many people who are now fellows thought their application was a long shot. Apply today.

**Are you still accepting applications for host newsrooms?**

No, we are not accepting host newsroom applications at this time—but we will be again in the spring of 2015.

**How do I contact you?**

We’re very reachable. You can [e-mail us](mailto:info@opennews.org), [find us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/opennews), reach us at our biweekly [community calls](https://wiki.mozilla.org/OpenNews/Calls), and even catch us on IRC via the #opennews channel on irc.mozilla.org. We’d love to hear from you and are happy to answer any questions you may have.
