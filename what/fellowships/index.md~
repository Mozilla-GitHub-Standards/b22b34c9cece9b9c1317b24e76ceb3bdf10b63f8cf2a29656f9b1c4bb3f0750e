###Being a fellow
Knight-Mozilla Fellows spend 10 months working with newsroom technology teams to write open-source code, analyze and visualize data, and explore tough problems facing journalism. Fellows have the [financial support](/what/fellowships/details) and time they need to explore journalism code, collaborate on open-source projects, and share their work at conferences around the world. In past years, [fellows have done](/what/fellowships/community/) research about security and analytics and built tools for extracting data from PDFs and crowdsourcing document analysis. Fellows build strong relationships with the fellows in their cohort as well as a growing community of alumni.

We embed fellows with a [partner news organization](/what/fellowships/partners) that provides space for the fellow, intriguing projects to work on, and an immersion into the culture of that newsroom. Fellows in 2016 will be placed with: Los Angeles Times Data Desk, NPR, Vox Media, Frontline,  Correct!v, and The Coral Project (a collaboration between the New York  Times, the  Washington Post, and Mozilla). Want to join them? [Apply now  to become a 2016 Knight-Mozilla Fellow](/what/fellowships/apply).

###Why work in journalism?
Journalism  influences [the web we inhabit](/blog/fellowships-open-web). Journalism shapes the web through code that was developed in newsrooms,  like Django and Backbone. Journalism drives web content, both stories that amuse and enrage as well as reporting that leads to meaningful changes in our communities. Journalism works at a scale that few other industries can muster--millions of readers engage with reporting every day.

The Knight-Mozilla Fellowship is a chance to be immersed in this work. Working in journalism means you do [challenging work that is deeply gratifying](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/planting-next-crop-newsroom-coders/). As advocates of the open web, we also see our work as a way to help make open technology options a realistic and attractive option for newsrooms, technically and culturally.

###Joining the fellowship
Applications to become a 2016 Knight-Mozilla are [open until August 21](/what/fellowships/apply). This fellowship affords a chance to experiment with technology in journalism and work on projects that interest you and your host newsroom. As a fellow, you would live and work for 10 months in the city where your host newsroom is located and work as a member of the newsroom team.

The kinds of projects fellows work on day-to-day are dictated by the host news organization and the fellow, and [have included projects focused on](/what/fellowships/community) data, mapping, elections, and impact analysis. If you already have ideas of things that interest you, whether it be news games or civic data crunching, that’s great. We’re looking for people who want to  experiment with technology in journalism, and fellows get plentiful room to figure out what those experiments should be.

You can learn more about the [financial and timing details of the fellowship](/what/fellowship/details) and the [application process](/what/fellowship/faq). If you don't see your questions answered, please [email us](mailto:info@opennews.org).
