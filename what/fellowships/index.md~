###Why work in journalism?
Journalism influences [the web we inhabit](/blog/fellowships-open-web). Journalism shapes the web through code that was developed in newsrooms, like Django and Backbone. Journalism drives web content, stories that amuse and enrage as well as reporting that leads to meaningful changes in our communities. Journalism works at a scale that few other industries can muster--millions of readers engage with reporting every day.

By working in journalism, the Knight-Mozilla Fellows help advocate for a web that is open, accessible, and ours. Like in open source code, openness is a core value in journalism--the information that reporters uncover and share with readers is critical to our ability to understand and support our communities. Knight-Mozilla Fellows become leaders in efforts to build tools and cultivate resources that enable news organizations to support healthy communities, online and off.

###Being a fellow
Knight-Mozilla Fellows spend 10 months working with newsroom technology teams to write open-source code, analyze and visualize data, and explore tough problems facing journalism. Fellows have the [financial support](/what/fellowships/info) and time they need to explore journalism code, collaborate on open-source projects, and share their work at conferences around the world. In past years, [fellows have done](/what/fellowships/community/) research about security and analytics and built tools for extracting data from PDFs and crowdsourcing document analysis. They build strong relationships with the other fellows in their cohort as well as a growing community of alumni.

We embed fellows with a [partner news organization](/what/fellowships/partners) that provides space for the fellow, intriguing projects to work on, and an immersion into the culture of that newsroom. Fellows in 2016 will be placed with: Los Angeles Times Data Desk, NPR, Vox Media, Frontline,  Correct!v, and The Coral Project (a collaboration between the New York  Times, the  Washington Post, and Mozilla).

Learn more about the [financial and timing details](/what/fellowships/info) of the fellowship and the [application process](/what/fellowships/faq), which will reopen in mid-2016.

###Connecting a community

The Knight-Mozilla Fellows join a community that works at the intersection of journalism and technology. In and around newsrooms, developers, designers, civic hackers, and data crunchers create the stories and tools that help journalism thrive on the web. OpenNews supports the fellows and other members of this community in sharing and strengthening their work.

Fellows join a network of contributors to [our website Source](/what/community/source/), which is a place for the journalism code community to write about projects, code, and best practices. Through Source, writers build their profile in the community and readers build their skills. That learning and sharing continues at [our conference SRCCON](/what/conferences/srccon) and [local events](/what/community/eventsupport) that OpenNews sponsors. Through [code convenings](/what/community/convenings), we support the release of even more open-source code by bringing together small teams from newsrooms to complete last-mile code and documentation of projects. 

The Knight-Mozilla Fellowship is one part of the networked approach of OpenNews. We connect and support the people and projects in the journalism code community to ensure that this work can continue to grow and thrive.
