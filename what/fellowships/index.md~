###Being a fellow
The Knight-Mozilla Fellowship is an opportunity for people who love to  solve problems through code to bring their skills to a newsroom for 10  months. Fellows have the [financial support](/what/fellowships/details) and time they need to explore journalism code, collaborate on open-source projects, and share their work at conferences around the world. In past years, [fellows  have done](/what/fellowships/community/) research about security and analytics and built tools for extracting data from PDFs and crowdsourcing document analysis. Fellows work with newsroom colleagues, the larger journalism-code community, and with the  other fellows in their cohort. Fellows build strong relationships with the fellows in their cohort as well as a growing community of alumni.

We embed fellows with a [partner news organization](/what/fellowships/partners) that provides space for the fellow, intriguing projects to work on, and an immersion into the culture of that newsroom. Fellows in 2016 will be placed with: Los Angeles Times Data Desk, NPR, Vox Media, Frontline,  Correct!v, and The Coral Project (a collaboration between the New York  Times, the  Washington Post, and Mozilla). Want to join them? [Apply now  to become a 2016 Knight-Mozilla Fellow](/what/fellowships/apply).

###Why work in journalism?
Journalism  influences [the web we inhabit](making the case blogpost). Journalism shapes the web through code like  Django and Backbone that was developed in newsrooms. Journalism drives  content on the web, both stories that amuse and enrage as well as  reporting that leads to meaningful changes in our communities.  Journalism works at a scale that few other industries can  muster--millions of readers engage with reporting every day.

The  Knight-Mozilla Fellowship is a chance to be immersed in this work.  Working in journalism means you do [challenging work that is deeply  gratifying](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/planting-next-crop-newsroom-coders/).  As advocates of the open web, we are especially invested in making open  technology options a realistic and attractive option for newsrooms,  technically and culturally.

###Joining the fellowship
Applications  to become a 2016 Knight-Mozilla are open until August 21. This  fellowship affords a chance to experiment with technology in journalism  and work on projects that interest you and your news partner. As a  fellow, you would live and work for 10 months in the city where your  host newsroom is located and work as a member of the newsroom team.

You  can learn more about the [financial and timing details of the  fellowship](details) and the [application process](). If you don't see  your questions answered, please [email us](mailto:info@opennews.org). 

The  kinds of projects fellows work on day-to-day are dictated by the  news  organization and the fellow, and include projects focused on data,   mapping, research, and impact analysis. If you already have ideas of   things that interest you, whether it be news games or civic data   crunching, that’s great. We’re looking for people who want to  experiment  with technology in journalism, and fellows get plentiful  room to figure  out what those experiments should be.
