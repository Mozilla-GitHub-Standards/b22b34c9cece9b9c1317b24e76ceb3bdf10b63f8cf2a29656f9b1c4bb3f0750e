###FELLOWSHIP TIMELINE
2016 fellowships begin in calendar year 2016 and last for 10 months. Each fellow's start date will be individualized for the needs of that fellow and the news organization, but most fellowships will begin in February or March of 2016.

Fellows are based, unless special circumstances dictate, in the town of their host news organization.

Our fellowship locations for 2016 are:

* Correct!v - Berlin, Germany

* Frontline - Boston, MA
* Los Angeles Times Data Desk - Los Angeles, CA
* NPR - Washington, DC
* Vox Media - Austin, TX; New York, NY; or Washington, DC

We make every attempt to match skills of fellows with needs of news organizations when connecting fellow to their host organization.

###STIPEND AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS
The Knight-Mozilla Fellowship is designed to allow flexibility for both fellows and fellowship Partners. **The standard fellowship offers a stipend of $60,000, paid in 10 monthly installments.** fellows are responsible for remitting all applicable taxes and other government payments as required.

Mozilla may, in consultation with fellows and fellowship Partners, elect to vary the amount and duration to accommodate the needs and availability of individual fellows and newsrooms.

To help offset cost of living, the fellowship also provides supplements for childcare and health insurance, and helps pay for research/equipment and books. If you relocate for a fellowship, we will also supplement your housing and moving expenses. The fellowship also covers the costs of required travel for fellowship activities.
