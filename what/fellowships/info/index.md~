<p class="bodybig">The Knight-Mozilla Fellowships present a unique opportunity for  people  who love to code and who want to influence the future of journalism on  the web. <a href="/what/fellowships/apply">Apply today</a>. You have the chance to get paid to spend 10 months learning, contributing to open-source code, and sharing your work.</p>

<p>We want you to be able to participate--along with your whole family! We've structured this program and its financial supports to be responsive to the needs of fellows in a variety of circumstances. The fellowship gives you the time and support you need to immerse yourself in the journalism code community and work on some great projects. </p>

###THE FELLOWSHIP
**What is the Knight-Mozilla Fellowship?**

    [answer that we workshop]

**What do fellows do?**

Over the past four years, fellows have created open-source projects, traveled the world sharing their work, and built strong relationships with their cohort and the wider journalism-code community. We welcome the fellows at the start of their fellowship ([get to know them](/what/fellowships/2015meet)) and support [their work during and after the fellowship](/what/fellowships/community/). 

**Who can become a fellow?**

It could be you. Anyone who loves to solve problems via code and has an  interest in journalism. You do not have to have previous experience with journalism. You also do not have to have experience with any particular programming language. A lot of news app development happens in the front-end, especially mapping and visualization, and people with those skills are highly sought after. Statistics, data, and even hard math skills are also great.

And you can be from anywhere. We are an international program and welcome participants from around the world. You do not need to be a U.S. citizen to participate in the program. We assist fellows with any necessary visa applications for working and traveling during the fellowship. We make our best effort to handle any visa needs a fellow may have, but it is possible that visa requirements may affect your ability to participate in the fellowship. If you are concerned that this may be the case for you, it is something we can investigate at the finalist stage of [the application process](/what/fellowships/faq). Do not let visa questions hold you back from applying. We still want to hear from you.

The only way to find out a definitive answer to this is to [apply](/what/fellowships/apply). (And  even then, several of our fellows have been selected on their second or third try applying.)

**Where would I work?**

Fellows are based, unless special circumstances dictate, in the town of their host news organization.

Our fellowship locations for 2016 are:

* Correct!v - Berlin, Germany
* The Coral Project - New York, NY (based out of the New York Times)
* Frontline - Boston, MA
* Los Angeles Times Data Desk - Los Angeles, CA
* NPR - Washington, DC
* Vox Media - Austin, TX; New York, NY; or Washington, DC

During the week of August 10, each news organization will describe what they are looking for in a fellow and the types of projects they are excited to work on with a fellow. Keep up with [@OpenNews](https://twitter.com/opennews) to follow those posts.

**When would I start?**

2016  fellowships begin in calendar year 2016 and last for 10 months. Each fellow’s start date will be individualized for the needs of that fellow and the news organization, but most fellowships will begin in February or March of 2016.

###STIPEND AND FINANCIAL BENEFITS
The Knight-Mozilla Fellowship is designed to allow flexibility for both fellows and fellowship Partners. **The standard fellowship offers a stipend of $60,000, paid in 10 monthly installments.** fellows are responsible for remitting all applicable taxes and other government payments as required.

Mozilla may, in consultation with fellows and fellowship Partners, elect to vary the amount and duration to accommodate the needs and availability of individual fellows and newsrooms.

To help offset cost of living, the fellowship also provides supplements for childcare and health insurance, and helps pay for research/equipment and books. If you relocate for a fellowship, we will also supplement your housing and moving expenses. The fellowship also covers the costs of required travel for fellowship activities.
