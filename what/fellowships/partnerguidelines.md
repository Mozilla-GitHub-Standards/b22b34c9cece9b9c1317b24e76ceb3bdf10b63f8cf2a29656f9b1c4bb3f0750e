<p class="bodybig">The partners who host our Knight-Mozilla fellows do much more than simply offer a desk at their news organization and gain extra expertise for their team: they are crucial partners who help select, mentor, and advise our fellows as well as offering them access to journalistic problem-sets and experts within their newsrooms.</p>

We look for fellowship partners who:

* have a track record of innovation in newsroom code and demonstrate investment in strengthening and leading the journalism-code community
* situate at least one development team in the newsroom
* can define a specific problem or project they'd like their fellow to work on
* commit to being involved in other OpenNews endeavors, including Source and code convenings
* commit to cover travel costs for a representative to attend a total of four OpenNews related events (two years of the annual Mozilla Festival, an onboarding event, and one other event)

 If you have any questions about becoming a fellowship partner for 2016, [please contact us](mailto:info@opennews.org). In the spring of 2015, we'll update this page with details about the application process to become a fellowship partner. And if being a fellowship partner doesnâ€™t sound like a fit for your organization, check out the many other ways we [work with newsrooms](/getinvolved/newspartners.html).
