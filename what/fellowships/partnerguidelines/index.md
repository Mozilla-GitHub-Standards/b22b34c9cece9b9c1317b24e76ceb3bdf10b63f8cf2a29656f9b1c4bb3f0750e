<p class="bodybig"> From April 1 to April 24 we will accept applications from news organizations interested in hosting a fellow in 2016. Please <a href="#form">sign up below</a> to receive an email when we launch the application.</p>

The partners who host our Knight-Mozilla fellows do much more than simply offer a desk at their news organization and gain extra expertise for their team: they are crucial partners who help select, mentor, and advise our fellows as well as offering them access to journalistic problem-sets and experts within their newsrooms.

We look for fellowship partners who:

* have a track record of innovation in newsroom code and demonstrate investment in strengthening and leading the journalism-code community
* situate at least one development team in the newsroom
* can define a specific problem or project they'd like their fellow to work on
* commit to being involved in other OpenNews endeavors, including Source and code convenings
* commit to cover travel costs for a representative to attend a total of four OpenNews related events (two years of the annual Mozilla Festival, an onboarding event, and one other event)

If you have are interested in becoming a fellowship partner in 2016, please add your details below so we can email you when the application is available. We'll accept applications from news organizations from April 1-24, review the applications and interview candidates in May, and announce the 2016 cohort of fellowship partners in early June when we start the fellowship search. If being a fellowship partner doesnâ€™t sound like a fit for your organization, [check out the many other ways](http://opennews.org/getinvolved/newspartners/) we work with newsrooms.
