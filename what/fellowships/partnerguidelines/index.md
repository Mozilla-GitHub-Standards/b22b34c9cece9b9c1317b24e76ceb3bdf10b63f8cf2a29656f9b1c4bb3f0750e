<p class="bodybig">
From April 1 to April 24 we will <a href="#form">accept applications</a> from news organizations interested in hosting a fellow in 2016. Apply to host a 2016 Knight-Mozilla Fellow today!
</p>
The partners who host our Knight-Mozilla fellows do much more than simply offer a desk at their news organization and gain extra expertise for their team: they are crucial partners who help select, mentor, and advise our fellows as well as offering them access to journalistic problem-sets and experts within their newsrooms.

We look for fellowship partners who:

* have a track record of innovation in newsroom code and demonstrate investment in strengthening and leading the journalism-code community
* situate at least one development team in the newsroom
* can define a specific problem or project they'd like their fellow to work on
* commit to being involved in other OpenNews endeavors, including Source and code convenings
* commit to cover travel costs for a representative to attend a total of four OpenNews related events (two years of the annual Mozilla Festival, an onboarding event, and one other event)

If you are a newsroom that would like to apply to host a Knight-Mozilla Fellow in 2016 [please fill out our application below](#form) by April 24.

If you want to learn more about how to become involved as a OpenNews Fellowship Partner for 2016, [please contact us](mailto:info@opennews.org). We’d love to chat, but please do fill out the form as well. We’ll accept applications from news organizations from April 1-24, review the applications and interview candidates in May, and announce  the 2016 cohort of fellowship partners in early June when we start the fellowship search.

If being a Fellowship partner doesn’t sound like a fit for your news organization, please [check out the other ways](/newspartners/) OpenNews partners with newsrooms.
